1. Initialize variable currentAge and set it to 0.
2. Initialize variable retirementAge and set it to 0.
3. Initialize variable currentYear and set it to the current year.
4. Prompt the user for currentAge.
5. Prompt the user for retirementAge.
6. If retirementAge <= currentAge, print "You can already retire."
7. Else,
  1. Calculate yearsUntilRetirement as retirementAge - currentAge.
  2. Calculate retirementYear as currentYear + yearsUntilRetirement.
  3. Print "You have yearsUntilRetirement years left until you can retire."
  4. Print "It's currentYear, so you can retire in retirementYear."
